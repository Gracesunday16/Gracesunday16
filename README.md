## 👋 Hi, I'm Grace Sunday!

## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I’m Grace Sunday, a passionate and detail-oriented Data Analyst with a background in pharmaceutical microbiology and research. I specialize in turning raw data into actionable insights that help organizations make informed, data-driven decisions.

My journey into analytics is fueled by curiosity, continuous learning, and a deep desire to solve real-world problems through data. Whether it's cleaning complex datasets, building dashboards, or uncovering trends with SQL, I find purpose in every line of code and every visual I create.

With a strong foundation in tools like Python, SQL, Excel, Looker Studio, Tableau, and BigQuery, I’ve built projects that measure business performance, campaign effectiveness, and operational efficiency. I have also completed a professional data analytics training that equips me with real-industry projects and collaboration experience.

## 🎯 Mission

To empower businesses and communities to make smarter decisions through meaningful data analytics.  

I aim to bridge the gap between raw data and business value by delivering clean, clear, and actionable insights through engaging visualizations and efficient reporting tools.

I believe that every dataset tells a story, and my goal is to help businesses listen, understand, and act.

## 🌟 Vision

To become a high-impact data and business intelligence analyst, known for crafting data solutions that improve decision-making, performance, and growth.

I aspire to work on innovative projects that combine data, strategy, and human insight to create value in industries like healthcare, retail, and development.

In the long run, I envision mentoring young analysts, contributing to open-source data communities, and leading data projects that drive social change and business transformation.
